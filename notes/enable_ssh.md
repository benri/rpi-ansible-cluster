# Enable SSH

## Enable SSH on a headless Raspberry Pi (add file to SD card on another machine)

For headless setup, SSH can be enabled by placing a file named `ssh`, without any extension, onto the boot partition of the SD card from another computer. When the Pi boots, it looks for the `ssh` file. If it is found, SSH is enabled and the file is deleted. The content of the file does not matter; it could contain text, or nothing at all.

If you have loaded Raspberry Pi OS onto a blank SD card, you will have two partitions. The first one, which is the smaller one, is the boot partition. Place the file into this one.

## CLI

```
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```
